Exercise: Regularization

In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and regularized logistic regression.

Data

To begin, download ex5Data.zip and extract the files from the zip file. This data bundle contains two sets of data, one for linear regression and the other for logistic regression. It also includes a helper function named 'map_feature.m' which will be used for logistic regression. Make sure that this function's m-file is placed in the same working directory where you plan to write your code.
